# doh-client
`doh-client` is a DNS over HTTPS client, which opens a local UDP (DNS) port and forwards all DNS queries to a remote HTTP/2.0 server.
By default the client will connect to the Cloudflare DNS service.
It uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) for all asynchronous IO operations and [Rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) to connect to the HTTPS server.

## Getting Started
`doh-client` is written in Rust. To build it you need the Rust compiler and build system `cargo`.

### Build
```
$ cargo build
```
or to build it as release build
```
$ cargo build --release
```

### Run
To run the binary, you need one option (see [Options](Options))
```
$ ./doh-client --cafile /path/to/the/ca/file.pem
```
For example if you use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) then the following command uses the system cert store:
```
# ./doh-client --cafile /etc/ca-certificates/extracted/tls-ca-bundle.pem
```

## Options
`doh-client` has one required option, `--cafile` which sets path to a pem file, which contains the trusted CA certificates.
```
$ ./doh-client --help
